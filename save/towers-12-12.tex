\section{Introduction}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

	Recently we revisited the problem of  the BPS kink spectrum in 
	the supersymmetric CP$^{N-1}$ model with $\mc{Z}_N$-symmetric twisted masses 
	\cite{Bolokhov:2011mp} in connection with the studies of the curves of marginal stability.
	We derived the BPS spectrum by combining three requirements: (i) at small values of the mass terms, i.e. at strong 
	coupling, the solution implied by the mirror representation \cite{MR1,MR2}, in the first order in the twisted 
	masses \cite{Shifman:2010id}; (ii) consistency in the Argyres--Douglas points, and 
	(iii) quasiclassical limit which had been analyzed previously in \cite{Dor}. 
	Our analysis is based on the  superpotential of the Veneziano--Yankielowicz type that is
	exact in the BPS sector. This potential is presented by a multibranch (and, hence, multivalued)
	function. Therefore, a disambiguation is necessary. The combination of the above three requirements led us
	to an unambiguous prediction. A 
	a surprising finding is: in the ${\mathcal N} =2$ CP$^{N-1}$ model with  $\mc{Z}_N$-symmetric twisted masses
	there are $N-1$ towers of BPS saturated kinks. The previous studies in the literature mention a single tower. 
	Only this single  tower is seen in the quasiclassical analysis in \cite{Dor}.
	
	Since the CP$^{N-1}$ model with $\mc{Z}_N$ -symmetric twisted masses appears as a low-energy theory on
	the world sheet of non-Abelian strings \cite{Shifman:2004dr} supported in certain four-dimensional ${\mathcal N} =2$
	gauge theories with $N=N_f$, the prediction for the BPS spectrum in two dimensions can be elevated to four dimensions.
	Thus, our formula simultaneously describes confined monopoles in the Higgs phase of the four-dimensional gauge theory,
	as explained e.g. in the review paper   \cite{Shifman:2007ce}.
	Thus, we predict that at large values of the mass differences of the (s)quark fields
	(which translate into the twisted masses in 2D)  these monopoles appear in the spectrum in the form of 
	the same $N-1$ towers.
	
	In this paper we will discuss the origin and the physical meaning of the phenomenon of $N-1$ towers for 
	kinks in 2D/monopoles in 4D. To avoid bulky notation and excessive 
	technicalities we will mostly focus on the simplest nontrivial example,
	that of CP$^2$. Generalization to CP$^{N-1}$ is conceptually straightforward. We will briefly discuss it at the end.
	
	For arbitrary $N$ the $Z_N$ symmetric twisted mass parameters are defined as
	\beq
\label{mcirc}
	m_k ~~=~~ m_0 \cdot e^{2 \pi i k / N}\,,\qquad\qquad k~=~0\,,~1\,,~ ...\,,~ N-1\,;
\eeq
	the set of the mass parameters depends on  a single complex parameter $ m_0 $.
	In what follows we will assume $m_0$ to be real. For $N=3$ we have three mass parameters, 
	and two masses in the geometric formulation (they can be viewed as mass terms of the 
	elementary fermion excitations), namely
\begin{eqnarray}
	&& 
	m_0\,,\qquad  m_1 ~~=~~ m_0\, e^{2 \pi i  / 3},\,\qquad m_2 ~~=~~ m_0\, e^{-2 \pi i  / 3}\,,
	\nonumber\\[2mm]
	&&
	\quad M_1 ~~=~~ m_1 ~-~ m_0\, , \qquad M_2 ~~=~~ m_2 ~-~ m_0 \,.
\end{eqnarray}

	In our previous paper \cite{Bolokhov:2011mp} for the sake of defining the spectrum we introduced a function $ U_0(m_0) $,
\beq
	U_0 (m_0) ~~=~~ \left(\, e^{2 \pi i / N} ~-~ 1 \,\right) \cdot \mc{W}(\sigma_0)\,,
\eeq
	which we argued to be a single-valued quantity in a physical region of the mass parameter $ m_0 $
	($\mc{Z}_N$-invariance divides the complex plane of $ m_0 $ into $ N $ equivalent physical regions
	each $ 360^\circ/N $ degrees wide).
	We showed that mirror-symmetry analysis requires that at strong coupling there be $ N $ states
	with 
\beq
\label{Usp}
	\mc{Z} ~=~ U_0(m_0) ~+~ i\,m_k
\eeq
	which should also be seen in quasiclassics.
	We also suggested that these states at the weak coupling may be promoted to whole towers.
	The question remained of what these states represent when extrapolated all the way into the
	weak coupling region. 

	Before returning to the question of the spectrum, we first show how the moduli space of parameter
	$ m_0 $ looks like in CP$^{N-1}$, and in CP$^2$ in particular. 
	Such an analysis is also important in the view of the related question of 
	two-dimensional --- four-dimensional duality of the spectrum.
	It turns out that $ U_0(m_0) $ does not by itself provide a meaningful topological contribution
	to the central charge.
	Speaking in terms of four dimensions, one would like to be able to separate out 
	the magnetic contribution $ \vec{n}{}_m \cdot \vec{a}{}_D $ in the central charge.
	What we argue below is that $ U_0(m_0) $ by itself does not completely account for the 
	magnetic/topological part.
	Jumping ahead, we can state that, depending on the patch of the moduli space, 
	the topological part is given by
\beq
	U_0 ~~+~~ i\, m_k ~~=~~ \mc{W}(\sigma_1) ~~-~~ \mc{W}(\sigma_0) \,,
	\qquad\qquad k ~=~ 0,\,...\,,\, N-1\,.
\eeq
	All these quantities are functions of $ m_0 $.
	A reference patch can be defined so that the topological part equals
\beq
	U_0 ~~+~~ i\, m_0 ~~=~~ \mc{W}(\sigma_1) ~~-~~ \mc{W}(\sigma_0) \,.
\eeq
	It is this contribution which one needs to identify with $ \vec{n}{}_m \cdot \vec{a}{}_D $.
	The strong coupling spectrum \eqref{Usp} can then be written as
\beq
	\mc{W}(\sigma_1) ~~-~~ \mc{W}(\sigma_0) ~~+~~ i\, ( m_k \,-\, m_0 )\,.
\eeq
	In this form, the central charges are very suggestive to be those of the bound states 
	of a kink and elementary quanta \cite{Dorey:1999zk}.
	In four dimensions, this would correspond to the bound states of a monopole and quarks.
	Before discussing the semi-classical implications of such an interpretation, we first
	consider the moduli space of the mass parameter, 
	in order to correctly introduce the above quantities.

%%	 U_0 (m_0) + i\, \vec{N} \cdot \vec{m}\,,\nonumber\\[3mm]

\section{Exact Analysis}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

	In \ntwoo supersymmetric CP$^{N-1}$ theory one has the exact superpotential which
	should describe the whole spectrum non-perturbatively.
	We accept a normalization, in which the vacuum values of the exact superpotential take 
	the appearance as
\beq
\label{Wvac}
	\W ( \sigma_p ) ~~=~~ 
		-\, \frac{1}{2\pi}\,  
                \Bigl\{\, N\, \sigma_p ~+~ \sum_j\, m_j\, \ln \,\frac{\sigma_p - m_j}{\Lambda} \,\Bigr\}\,.
\eeq
	For the rest of this paper, we put $ \Lambda $ equal one.
	Here $ \sigma_p $ refers to the $p$-th vacuum.
	In our case of $ \mc{Z}_N $-symmetric masses, the vacua are found as
\beq
\label{sig}
	\sigma_p^N  ~~=~~ 1 ~~+~~ m_0^N \,.
\eeq
	All these quantities become functions of a single parameter $ m_0 $.
	The spectrum, {\it i.e.} the central charges of both perturbative and non-perturbative states 
	are given by the differences of the vacuum values of the superpotential.
	The masses of the elementary BPS kinks will be given by the differences of superpotential in
	two neighbouring vacua.
	Because of the $ \mc{Z}_N $ symmetry of the problem one can always choose the latter to be 
	the (0)-th and the (1)-st vacua.
	The masses of elementary states are obtained as differences of the superpotential in the
	same vacua, but with the mass parameter $ m_0 $ sitting on different branches of 
	the relevant logarithms.

	The problem with these expressions, as emphasized in \cite{Bolokhov:2011mp}, sits in their 
	multi-valuedness.
	This appears both in the logarithms in Eq.~\eqref{Wvac} as well as in the $ N $-th root in Eq.~\eqref{sig}.
	The correct handling of the superpotential involves analysis of the whole complex manifold
	of the mass parameter.
	In the case of a general $ N $ such a manifold can have a rather complicated structure.
	We make a few general statements regarding the superpotential in a CP$^{N-1}$ theory,
	and we are able to build the entire complex manifolds in the cases of 
	CP$^1$ and CP$^2$.

\subsection{Smart and Silly Logarithms}

	As we pointed out, the expression for $ \mc{W}(\sigma_0) $ is highly ambiguous.
	Even more so is the expression
\beq
\label{diff}
	\mc{W}(\sigma_1) ~~-~~ \mc{W}(\sigma_0)\,,
\eeq
	which should correspond to the physical masses.
	We need to mathematically correctly pin-point what we understand under the name of logarithms 
	and $ N $-th roots in our expressions.
	We can picture two schemes how one can do so. 

	We repeat that the whole spectrum is contained in the multi-valued expression \eqref{diff}.
	The mass parameter $ m_0 $ can travel through different branches of the logarithms, and
	the latter change as continuous functions.
	Indeed, the logarithms defined on multiple branches do not have any discontinuities,
	as this is the reason why the branches are introduced in the first place. 
	So these are the ``smart'' logarithms, which give one all physical states. 
	They are slightly ``smarter'' than ordinary multi-branched logarithms, since they also should tell us
	which states so obtained are physically stable and which are not. 

	Such quantities are very difficult to deal with. 
	It is also not very plausible to use such quantities numerically.
	So the other scheme to correctly work with multi-valuedness corresponds to the conventional prescription, 
	where one introduces branch cuts on a single complex plane. 
	We accept a definition of the function $ \log~x $, such that
\beq
	\log~x ~~\in~~ \mc{R}\,, \qquad\qquad \text{when~~} x ~>~ 0\,.
\eeq
	We draw a branch cut of this logarithm to extend from the origin to the negative infinity,
\beq
	\text{branch cut:}\qquad -\infty ~~<~~ x ~~<~~ 0\,,
\eeq
	and put the argument of complex variable to be in the usual domain,
\beq
	-\,\pi ~~<~~  \text{Im}~\log x  ~~\leq~~ \pi\,.
\eeq
	This function is defined on a single complex plane and it does not know about various branches.
	For this reason such quantities can be called ``silly'' logarithms.
	Whenever $ x $ steps on a different branch, one needs to add a $ 2 \pi i $ explicitly.
	These logarithms have a discontinuity across the branch cut.
	But, introduction of them allows us to speak about the spectrum in a little more concentrated way. 

	All forementioned to some extent relates to the definition of $ \sigma_p $ as well.
	However, there is a crucial difference that only one complex branch of the $ N $-th root corresponds
	to a physical vacuum.
	Indeed, at large values of masses, the vacua $ \sigma_p $ take on classical values,
\beq
\label{sigclass}
	\sigma_p  ~~\approx~~ m_p\,,  \qquad\qquad\qquad |m_p| ~\gg~ 1\,.
\eeq
	This can be viewed as the definition of the physical branch of $ m_0 $ with respect to $ \sigma_p $.
	Stepping out of that branch, leads to the same spectrum obtained with a permutation of the vacua.
	Although in principle, the analysis of the whole complex manifold should include 
	all physically-equivalent branches of the root, we do not do this, 
	limiting ourselves to a physical single branch.
	Thus we denote the $ N $-root as a function on a single complex plane, such that
\beq
	\sqrt[N]{x} ~~>~~ 0\,, \qquad\qquad \text{when~~} x ~>~ 0\,,
\eeq
	and define
\beq
	\sigma_p ~~=~~ e^{2 \pi i p / N} \cdot \sigma_0 ~~=~~ e^{2 \pi i p / N} \cdot \sqrt[N]{ 1 ~+~ m_0^N }\,.
\eeq
	The branch cuts of this root in the $ m_0 $ plane should be sketched in such a way as to preserve
	the classical relation \eqref{sigclass}.
	

	It is obvious that the physical values of the central charge 
\beq
\label{ccharge}
	\mc{Z} ~~=~~ \W(\sigma_p) ~~-~~ \W(\sigma_q)
\eeq
	are given by the ``smart'' logarithms inside the functions $ \W(\sigma) $.
	For the rest of the paper, however, we will denote $ \W(\sigma_p) $ a function 
\beq
\label{Wv}
	\W ( \sigma_p ) ~~=~~ 
		-\, \frac{1}{2\pi}\,  
                \Bigl\{\, N\, \sigma_p ~+~ \sum_j\, m_j\, \log\, \big( \sigma_p - m_j \big) \,\Bigr\}
\eeq
	expressed in terms of the silly logarithms. 
	For each moduli manifold, we therefore will need to introduce a set of branch cuts and 
	specify how the logarithms should jump in order to account for passing onto a different branch.
	Such a jump, proportional to the mass $ m_j $, should imitate the ``smart'' logarithm,
	which is continuous.
	The jump is introduced precisely to compensate for the discontinuity of the ``silly'' logarithms.
	As defined, function \eqref{Wv} does not know which branch we are currently sitting on.
	Therefore, we will need to also specify a reference point from which we start accounting.
	All the rest places of the manifold are reached by passing from this reference point to a
	particular destination point along a contour.
	While passing along the contour, we pick up all the jumps that occur on the ``edges'' of 
	branches, while, again, \eqref{Wv} does not know that we are in fact jumping from
	branch to branch.

\subsection{Complex manifold of \boldmath{$ m $} in CP\boldmath{$^{N-1}$}}

	The  complex manifold for a general CP$^{N-1}$ case will be rather complicated and include
	multiple branch cuts of the logarithms.
	We do not perform a full analysis of all such manifolds, which will also depend on 
	the parity of $ N $.
	But we still make a few general statements regarding these manifolds and behaviour of function $ \W(\sigma_p) $.
	For simplicity, we denote it as
\beq
	\W_p ~~\stackrel{\text{def}}{=} ~~ \W(\sigma_p)\,,
\eeq
	and always remember that it is a function of $ m_0 $.

\begin{figure}

\caption{General appearance of a complex moduli space of $ m $ in the case of CP$^{N-1}$. 
	 Solid lines sketch the logarithmic branch cuts, dashed lines show the branch cuts of the $N$-root in $\sigma$.
	 See text.}
\label{fcpn}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
	Figure~\ref{fcpn} shows a schematic appearance of a moduli space in CP$^{N-1}$.
	The complex plane is diced by various branch cuts of the logarithms.
	We immediately comment that these branch cuts are non-compact, 
	{\it i.e.} they extend from infinity to infinity.
	This is related to the fact that the logarithms depend on combinations $ \sigma_p \,-\, m_j $,
	rather than just on masses $ m_j $ themselves.
	Branch cuts appears in the places where these differences become real and negative.
	As such differences never vanish for finite $ m_0 $, the branch cuts may terminate only at infinity. 
	In general, each branch cut is shared by multiple logarithms.

	There are $ N $ AD points which are located at positions defined by
\beq
	\left( m^\text{AD} \right)^N ~~=~~ -1 \,.
\eeq
	The reason for the particular numbering of the AD points shown in the figure will become clear in just a moment.
	The points are enclosed by ``cups'' of hyperbolic-shaped logarithmic branch cuts.
	There are also $ N - 1 $ branch cuts of the $ N $-root coming from the definition of $ \sigma_p $ \eqref{sig}.
	They can be chosen so as to connect the AD points, as shown by the dashed lines.
	As one crosses such a branch cut, the phase of each $ \sigma_p $ experiences a jump, 
	coherent to classical relation \eqref{sigclass}. 
	If one starts at the origin and crosses the branch cut connecting AD$^{N-1}$ and AD$^0$, 
	the vacua shift as $ \sigma_p \,\to\, \sigma_{p-1} $.
	If instead one crosses the branch cut connecting AD$^{N-2}$ and AD$^{N-1}$,
	the shift will be $ \sigma_p \,\to\, \sigma_{p-2} $.
	Following further counter-clockwise, if one crosses the $ k $-th branch cut 
	that connects AD$^{N-k}$ to AD$^{N-k+1}$ when passing from the inside outside, the vacua shift by $ k $ turns
\beq
\label{sigshift}
	\sigma_p ~~\to~~ \sigma_{p-k} \,.
\eeq
	In accord with this, a branch cut of logarithm $ \log\;( \sigma_p \,-\, m_j ) $ turns into 
	a branch cut of $ \log\;( \sigma_{p \pm k} \,-\, m_j ) $ after it crosses the $ k $-th branch cut of $ \sigma $. 
	The plus or minus sign will of course depend on the direct of this crossing. 
	The branch cut of $ \log\;( \sigma_p \,-\, m_j ) $ itself comes off the physical plane.

	For what follows, it is convenient to deform the branch cuts of $ \sigma $ so that they almost touch the origin.
	Each cut will start from an AD point, come infinitesimally close to the origin in a straight line, 
	then turn around and follow to the other AD point also in a straight line, this way making a letter ``v''.
	The system of the $ \sigma $ branch cuts will then form a star with the centre at the origin, as sketched in Fig.~\ref{fsigcpn}.
\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\epsfxsize=8.0cm
% \epsfbox{fsigcpn.eps}
\caption{Stretched branch cuts of $ \sigma $ in CP$^{N-1}$.}
\label{fsigcpn}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
	The convenience of such a configuration of cuts now shows in a simple relation,
\beq
\label{mjump}
	\text{as}~~ m_0 ~~\to~~ e^{2\pi i / N}\, m_0\,,  \qquad\qquad \sigma_p ~~\to~~ e^{2\pi i / N} \sigma_p\,.
\eeq
	That is, as $ m_0 $ jumps from one ``sector'' to another, the phase of $ \sigma_p $ jumps accordingly.
	That this is so at the weak coupling $ |m_0| \,\gg\, 1 $ is not a surprise, but a consequence of Eq.~\eqref{sigclass}.
	In the region of small $ m_0 $, however, this did not have to be so, and we have had to arrange the branch cuts 
	in a special way so that relation \eqref{mjump} is retained.

	Besides introducing the branch cuts, we also need to specify a reference point from which we start counting
	the central charge.
	We notice that, any AD point would do in particular.
	Say we pick AD$^{(p)}$.
	Then we automatically define the central charge of an elementary kink to vanish at AD$^{(p)}$,  just because
	all $ \sigma $'s are equal at an AD point.
	The value of the central charge in other places, in particular at AD points, is obtained by following
	a path connecting the reference point and the destination point, and accounting for the branch cuts
	along the way. 
	The central charge will not vanish at other AD points. 

	Since our problem has a $ Z_N $ symmetry, the complex plane of $ m_0 $ is split into $ N $ equivalent physical
	regions.
	Each physical region contains exactly one AD point.
	It does not matter where to start measuring the regions from.
	Because of the different branch cuts, the regions might seem non-equivalent to each other.
	The equivalence is of course reflected in the coincidence of the physical spectra in all these regions. 


	The description of the complex space given above is enough for us to introduce two relations which have
	direct connection to $ \mc{Z}_N $ symmetry of the theory.
	We notice that the superpotential
\beq
	\W_p ~~=~~ 
		-\, \frac{1}{2\pi}\,  
                \Bigl\{\, N\, \sigma_p ~+~ \sum_j\, m_j\, \ln\, \big( \sigma_p - m_j \big) \,\Bigr\}
\eeq
	seemingly has a $ \mc{Z}_N $ symmetry of its vacuum values. 
	Is it true indeed that the vacuum values of $ \W $ sit on a circle?
	The answer is no. 
	Instead, the differences of the vacuum values do,
\beq
	\W_{p+2}  ~~-~~  \W_{p+1}  ~~=~~ 
        e^{2 \pi i / N}\, \Bigl(\,  \W_{p+1}  ~~-~~ \W_{p}   \,\Bigr) \,.
\eeq
	Similar relations for the vacuum values themselves depend on the location in the moduli space.
	For us, immediate vicinities of the AD points are important reference locations.
	The branch cuts of the logarithms form ``cups'' around each of the AD points.
	Inside each of the cup, the following relations can be inferred,
\beq
\label{shift}
	\W_{p+1} ~~=~~ e^{2 \pi i / N} \cdot \W_p ~~+~~ i\, m_s\,,
\eeq
	and
\beq
\label{shiftm}
	\W_p\, (e^{2 \pi i / N} \cdot m_0) ~~=~~ e^{2 \pi i / N} \cdot \W_p\, (m_0) ~~+~~ i\, m_s\,.
\eeq
	Here $ s = 0 $ for AD$^{(0)}$, $ s = 1 $ for AD$^{(1)}$ {\it etc}, gives the numeration
	to AD points as shown in Fig.~\ref{fcpn}.

	As an application, Eq.~\eqref{shift} immediately gives us the values of $ \W_p $ at AD points.
	Indeed, at any such point $ \sigma_p \,=\, 0 $ and so all $ \W_p $ are equal.
	Therefore,
\beq
	\left(\, e^{2 \pi i / N} \;-\; 1 \,\right)\, \W_p\, \biggr|_\text{AD$^{(s)}$} ~~=~~ -\, i\, m_s\,.
\eeq
	The right hand side is different for all AD points, seemingly. 
	Upon a closer look, the value of $ m_s $ at the $ s $-th AD point is independent of $ s $ and equals
	$ |m_0|\,e^{i \pi / N} $.

\subsection{The moduli space of CP\boldmath{$^2$}}

	The moduli space in the case of CP$^2$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fcp2}. 
\begin{figure}

\epsfxsize=8.0cm
% \epsfbox{fcp2.eps}
\caption{Moduli space of CP$^2$.}
\label{fcp2}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
	It has hyperbolic branch cuts of the logarithms, determined by the equations
\beq
	\text{Re}~m^3 ~~=~~ -\,\frac{1}{2}\,.
\eeq
	The branch cuts belonging to the physical plane are marked with subscripts which
	identify them to their respective logarithms.
	Each line is a branch cut of two different logarithms. 
	The branch cuts of $ \sigma $, as discussed previously, can be chosen to connect the AD points.
	As the logarithm lines cross the $ \sigma $ branch cuts, they turn into branch
	cuts of other logarithms, in accord with \eqref{sigshift}.

	As discussed earlier, the logarithmic cuts form cups around the AD points. 
	Inside these cups, the following relations hold for the vacuum values of the superpotential,
\beq
	\W_{p+1} ~~=~~ e^{2 \pi i / 3} \cdot \W_p ~~+~~ i\, m_s\,, \qquad\quad s~=~0,~1,~2\,.
\eeq
	and
\beq
	\W_p\, (e^{2 \pi i / 3} \cdot m_0) ~~=~~ e^{2 \pi i / 3} \cdot \W_p\, (m_0) ~~+~~ i\, m_s
	\qquad\quad s~=~0,~1,~2\,.
\eeq
	Everywhere {\it outside} these cups, the superpotential values {\it are} sitting on the circle,
\beq
	\W_{p+1} ~~=~~ e^{2 \pi i / 3} \cdot \W_p
	\qquad\qquad \text{(outside the cups)}.
\eeq
	In particular, this is true on the real positive axis.
	This circumstance is very helpful in identifying the states seen as kinks in the mirror description.

	At this point we do not have yet an exact prescription how to choose a reference point.
	Let us pick the reference point to be AD$^{(2)}$, 
\beq
	m_\text{ref} ~~=~~ m_\text{AD}^{(2)} ~~=~~ -\,1\,.
\eeq
	We will justify this choice later.
	A state with topological charge
\beq
	\vec{T} ~~=~~ (\, -1\,,~~ 1\,,~ 0 \,,~~ ...\,,~~ 0 \,)
\eeq
	becomes massless at this point.
	We shall denote this state with letter $ \mc{M} $ to symbolize its resemblence with 
	the four-dimensional monopoles. 
	Its central charge is given by
\beq
	\mc{Z_M} ~~=~~ \W_1 ~~-~~ \W_0\,.
\eeq
	There are also dyonic states which are known to exist quasiclassically,
\beq
	\vec{T} ~~=~~ (\, -1\,,~~ 1\,,~ 0 \,,~~ ...\,,~~ 0 \,)\,, \qquad
	\vec{S} ~~=~~ (\, -n\,,~~ n\,,~ 0 \,,~~ ...\,,~~ 0 \,)\,, 
\eeq
	where $ n $ is an integer, and $ \vec{S} $ denotes the set of U(1) charges.
	The central charges of such states are given by 
\beq
	\mc{Z}_{\mc{D}^{(n)}} ~~=~~ \W_1 ~~-~~ \W_0\, ~~+~~ i\, n\, ( m_1 \,-\, m_0 ) \,.
\eeq
	We denote these dyonic states by $ \mc{D}^{(n)} $.

	There are three physically equivalent regions, each one containing an AD point.
	The monodromies of the moduli space work in such a way that as one passes from 
	one physical region to the next one counter-clockwise, the difference 
$ \W_1 ~-~ \W_0 $
	gains one unit of the U(1) charge,
\beq
	\W_1 ~~-~~ \W_0  ~~~\to~~~ \W_1 ~~-~~ \W_0 ~~+~~ i\,( m_1 \,-\, m_0 ) \,.
\eeq
	Since the $ \M $ state becomes massless at AD$^{(2)}$, the state $ \D^{(1)} $ will become
	massless at AD$^{(0)}$, and the state $ \D^{(-1)} $ at AD$^{(1)}$.
	The paths connecting the initial point AD$^{(2)}$ and the destination points AD$^{(0)}$ and AD$^{(1)}$
	lie outside the unit circle region, and 
	extend clockwise and counter-clockwise correspondingly.
	If we further extend these paths through their AD points and into the circle towards the origin,
	the masses of the states will become
\beq
	\W_1 ~~-~~ \W_0 ~~+~~ i\, m_{0,1}\,.
\eeq
	Now if take the $ \M $ state and push it through the point AD$^{(2)}$ towards the origin,
	its mass will become $ \W_1 ~-~ \W_0 ~+~ m_2 $, again, because of the branch cuts.
	All three states therefore can be written as
\beq
	\W_1 ~~-~~ \W_0 ~~+~~ i\, m_k\,,\qquad\qquad k~=~ 0,~1,~2\,.
\eeq
	Since in the area near the origin $ \W_1 ~=~ e^{2 \pi i / 3}\, \W_0 $, we obtain all three states 
	predicted by the mirror theory,
\beq
	(e^{2 \pi i /3} ~-~ 1)\, \W_0 ~~+~~ i\, m_k\,,\qquad\qquad k~=~ 0,~1,~2\,.
\eeq

	To clarify, these states are not the original dyonic states $ \D^{(n)} $ with $ n ~=~ -1 $,
	$ 0 $ and $ 1 $.
	They would be such if we had followed one and the same path for all three states from AD$^{(2)}$ to
	the origin, while we followed different paths.
	The procedure that we have done shows how the monodromies can be used to construct the spectrum
	seen in the mirror representation.

	We are now allowed to proceed with the three states into the quasiclassical region.
	The simplest way to do this is to follow the real positive axis from the origin towards infinity.
	As it will turn out, the quantum numbers of the three states that we have identified correspond to those
	of a purely topological state, a dyonic state, and a bound state of a topological and elementary states.
	The existence of the first two in the quasiclassical region $ m \,\gg\, 1 $ does not pose a doubt.
	Below we review the quasiclassical picture exhibiting the existence of the bound states at weak coupling.

\subsection{Central charge}

       The classical expression for the central charge has two contributions \cite{ls1}:
       the Noether and the topological terms,
\beq
        \mc{Z} ~~=~~ i\, M_a\, q^a  ~~+~~ \int\, dz\, \p_z\, O \,, \qquad\qquad
	a ~=~ 1,\,...\, N-1\,.
	\label{21}
\eeq
       where $ M^a $ are the twisted masses (in the geometric formulation),
\beq
       M_a  ~~=~~ m^a ~-~ m^0\,,
\eeq
$m^a$ (a=1,2, ..., N) are the masses in the gauge formulation, and the operator $O$ consists of two parts, canonical and anomalous,
\begin{eqnarray}
O & = &
O_{\rm canon} + O_{\rm anom},\\[2mm]
O_{\rm canon } 
\label{23}
& = &
\sum_{a= 1}^{N-1} M_a D^a,\\[2mm]
O_{\rm anom} 
\label{24}
& = &
- \frac{N\, g_0^2}{4\pi}\left(
\sum_{a=1}^{N-1} M_a D^a + g_{i\bar{j}} \,\bar \psi^{\bar{j}}\,\frac{1-\gamma_5}{2}\,\psi^i
\right).
\label{25}
\end{eqnarray}
Moreover, the Noether charges $ q^a $ can be obtained from $N-1$ U(1) currents $ J_\mu^a $
defined as\,\footnote{There is a typo in the definition of these currents in \cite{ls1}.}
\begin{eqnarray}
%
       J_{RL}^a  
       &=&
        g_{i\bj}\; \bphi^\bj\, (T^a)^{i\bj}\, i\overleftrightarrow{\p}{}_{\scriptscriptstyle \!\!\!\!RL}\, \phi^i   \nonumber\\[2mm]
%
                 & +&
                  \frac{1}{2}\, g_{i\bj}\; \bpsi{}_{\scriptscriptstyle LR}^\bmm

	                       \bphi{}^\br\, (T^a)_\br^{\ \bkk}\, \Gamma^{\;\bj}_{\bkk\bmm} \rgr   \psi_{\scriptscriptstyle LR}^i \nonumber \\[2mm]
%
                 & +&
                  \frac{1}{2}\, g_{i\bj}\; \bpsi{}_{\scriptscriptstyle LR}^\bj
                         \lgr  \delta^i_{\ p}\, (T^a)^p_{\ m} ~+~ 
		               \Gamma_{mk}^{\;i}\, (T^a)^k_{\ r}\, \phi^r \rgr   \psi_{\scriptscriptstyle LR}^m
\label{u1cur}
\end{eqnarray}
       in the geometric representation, and
\begin{align}
%
\notag
       J_{RL}^a  & ~~=~~ i\, \ov{n}{}_a \overleftrightarrow{\p}_{\scriptscriptstyle RL} n^a 
                   ~~-~~ |n^a|^2 \cdot i\, ( \ov{n} \overleftrightarrow{\p} n ) \\
%
                 & ~~+~~ \qquad 
                         \bxi{}_{\scriptscriptstyle LR}^a\, \xi_{\scriptscriptstyle LR}^a  ~~-~~
                         |n^a|^2 \cdot ( \bxi{}_{\scriptscriptstyle LR}\, \xi_{\scriptscriptstyle LR} )
\end{align}
       in the gauged formulation. Here
 \beq
 \left(T^a
 \right)^i_k = \delta_a^i\delta^a_k \,,\quad (\mbox{no summation over $a$!})
 \eeq
 and a similar expression for the overbarred indices.
Finally,
       $ D^a $ are the Killing potentials,
\beq
       D^a  ~~=~~ r_0\, \frac{ \bphi\,\, T^a\, \phi } 
                           {  1  ~+~  |\phi|^2  }
            ~~=~~ r_0\, \frac{ \bphi^a\, \phi^a   }
                           {  1  ~+~  |\phi|^2  }\,.
                           \label{29}
\eeq
       The generators $ T^a $ always pick up the $ a $-th component.
       In this expression, 
       \beq
       r _0=\frac{ 2 }{ g_0^2}
        \eeq 
        is a popular alternative notation for the sigma model coupling.
        
        Note that Eq. (\ref{29}) contains the bare coupling. It is clear that the one-loop correction must (and will) convert the bare coupling  into the renormalized coupling. The anomalous part $O_{\rm anom}$ is obtained at one loop.
        Therefore, in the one-loop approximation for the central charge 
        it is sufficient to treat $O_{\rm anom}$ in the lowest order. Moreover, the bifermion term 
        in $O_{\rm anom}$ plays a role only in the two-loop approximation. As a result, to calculate the central charge at one loop it is sufficient to analyze 
        the one-loop correction to $O_{\rm canon}$. The latter is determined by the tadpole graphs in Fig. XXX. As usual, the simplest way to perform the calculation is the background field method.
The part of the central charge under consideration is determined by the value of the fields at the spatial infinities. 
In the CP$^2$ model to be considered below there are three vacua and three possible ways
of interpolation between them. All kinks are equivalent. We will choose a  particular kink
corresponding to the following boundary conditions:
\beq
\phi^1 (z=-\infty ) = 0\,,\qquad \phi^1 (z=+\infty ) = \infty\,,\qquad  \phi^2 = 0\,.
\label{211}
\eeq
%%	We split the field $\phi$ into two parts,
%%\beq
%%	\phi = \phi_{\rm b} + \phi_{\rm qu}\,,
%%\label{212}
%%\eeq
%%	and expand $D^a$ in $\phi_{\rm qu}$ keeping  terms quadratic in $\phi_{\rm qu}$.
 
 
 
{\bf A digression is in order regarding the one-loop central charge in the gauged formulation}.
 $ D^a $ receives a one-loop contribution, due to $ r $, as is 
       most easily seen in the gauge representation of this operator,
\beq
       D^a  ~~=~~ r \cdot \ov{n}{}_a\, n^a \,,\qquad\qquad   | n_l |^2 ~=~ 1\,.
\eeq
       The renormalized operator contains the running coupling 
\beq
       r    ~~=~~ r_0  ~-~ \frac{N}{2\pi}\,\ln\, \frac{M_\text{uv}}
                                                      {   |M^a|   } \,.
\eeq
       In general, it is some typical mass scale that appears in the denominator of the logarithm, but, {\it e.g.}
       in CP$^2$ with $\mc{Z}_3$ twisted mass terms all masses and all mass differences have equal magnitude. 
       The UV cut-off $ M_\text{UV} $ and bare constant $ r_0 $ can be turned 
       into the strong coupling scale $ \Lambda $:
\beq
       r    ~~=~~ \frac{N}{2\pi}\, \ln\, \frac{   |M^a|   }
                                              {  \Lambda  }\,.
\eeq


       We will be looking for the semi-classical expression for the central charge in the presence
       of the soliton interpolating between vacua ({\sc \small 0}) and ({\sc \small 1})
\beq
       \phi^1(z)  \,~~=~~\, e^{|M^1| z}\,, \qquad\qquad  \phi^2(z) \,~~=~~\, \phi^3(z) \,~~=~~ \,~...~\, ~~=~~\, 0\,.
\eeq
       That this is the right kink can be seen in the gauged formulation,
\begin{align}
%
\notag
       n^0  & ~~=~~ \frac {             1              }
                          {\sqrt{ 1 ~+~ e^{2 |M^1| z} }}\,, \\[3mm]
%
\notag
       n^1  & ~~=~~ \frac {         e^{|M^1| z}        }
                          {\sqrt{ 1 ~+~ e^{2 |M^1| z} }}\,, \\[3mm]
%
\notag
       n^2  & ~~=~~ \qquad~~\, 0\,,  \\[2mm]
%	 
            & ~~~\,\vdots          \\[2mm]
%
\notag
       n^k  & ~~=~~ \qquad~~\, 0\,,  \\[2mm]
%	 
\notag
            & ~~~\,\vdots          \\[2mm]
%
\notag
       n^{N-1} & ~~=~~ \qquad~~\, 0\,.                
\end{align}

       In this background, $ D^a $ taken at the edges of the worldsheet yields just the coupling constant:
\beq
       D^a \Big|^{\scriptscriptstyle +\infty}_{\scriptscriptstyle -\infty} ~~=~~    r\,.
\eeq
       Therefore, the topological contribution to the central charge of the kink is
\beq
       \mc{Z} ~~\supset~~ \frac{N}{2\pi}\, M^1\, \ln\, \frac{   |M^a|   }
                                                            {  \Lambda  }\,.
\eeq

       As for the Noether contribution, the quantization of the ``angle'' coordinate of the kink gives 
\beq
       i\, n\, M^1\,,
\eeq
       with $ q^1 ~=~ n $ an integer number.
       As for the other $ q^k $, the kink does not have fermionic zero-modes of $ \psi^k $ with $ k = 2,\, 3,\, ...\, N-1 $.
       However, we will argue that there is a
       {\it non}-zero mode relevant to the problem of multiple towers that we consider (in fact, 
       the existence of this nonzero mode was noted by Dorey {\it et al.} \cite{Dorey:1999zk}).
       This mode describes a bound state of the kink and a fermion $ \psi^k $.

\subsection{Semiclassical calculation of the central charge in CP\boldmath{$^2$}}
     \label{semclas}
     
     If the twisted masses $M_a$ satisfy the condition
     \beq
     |M_a|\gg\Lambda\,,
     \eeq
       then we find ourselves at weak coupling where the one-loop calculation of the
       central charges will be sufficient for our purposes. This calculation can be carried out in a straightforward manner for all CP$^{N-1}$ models, 
       but for the sake if simplicity we will limit ourselves to CP$^2$. Generalization to larger $N$ is quite obvious. 
       
       In CP$^2$ there are two twisted mass parameters, $M_1$ and $M_2$, as shown in Fig. XXX.  
       Accordingly, there are two U(1) charges, see Eq. (\ref{u1cur}). The Noether charges are not renormalized; 
       therefore we will focus on the topological part represented by the Killing potentials, which are renormalized.

\subsubsection{Topological contribution}

One-loop calculations are most easily performed using the background field method.
For what follows it is important that $\phi^2_{\rm b}\equiv 0$ for the kink under consideration.
If so, all off-diagonal elements of the metric $g_{i\bar j}$ vanish, while the diagonal elements take the form
\begin{eqnarray}
&&
g_{1\bar 1}^{\rm b} \equiv g_{1\bar 1}\Big|_{\phi_{\rm b}} = \frac{2}{g_0^2}\,\frac {1}{\chi^2}\,,\nonumber\\[3mm]
&&
g_{2\bar 2}^{\rm b} \equiv 
g_{2\bar 2}\Big|_{\phi_{\rm b}} = \frac{2}{g_0^2}\,\frac {1}{\chi}\,,
\end{eqnarray}
where
\beq
\chi = 1 + \left| \phi^1_{\rm b}
\right|^2
\eeq
At the boundaries $\phi_{\rm b}^{1,2}$ take their (vacuum) coordinate-independent values;
therefore, the Lagrangian for the quantum fields can be written as
\beq
\mathcal{L}= g_{1\bar 1}^{\rm b} \left| \partial^\mu \phi^1_{\rm qu}\right|^2+
g_{2\bar 2}^{\rm b} \left| \partial^\mu \phi^2_{\rm qu}\right|^2 + ...
\label{324}
\eeq
where the ellipses stand for the terms irrelevant for our calculation.

The Killing potentials can be expanded in the same way. Under the condition $\phi^2_{\rm b}\equiv 0$ 
we arrive at
\begin{eqnarray}
D^1
&=&
 D^1\Big|_{\phi_{\rm b}} + \frac{2}{g_0^2}\, \frac{1-\left| \phi^1_{\rm b}
\right|^2}{\chi^3}\, \left|  \phi^1_{\rm qu}\right|^2 
- \frac{2}{g_0^2}\, \frac{\left| \phi^1_{\rm b}
\right|^2}{\chi^2}\, \left|  \phi^2_{\rm qu}\right|^2 + ...\,,
\nonumber\\[3mm]
D^2
&=&
0\,.
\label{325}
\end{eqnarray}
Equation (\ref{324})
implies that the Green's functions of the quantum fields are
\beq
\left\langle \phi^1_{\rm qu}, \phi^1_{\rm qu}\right\rangle = \frac{g_0^2\,\chi^2 }{2}\, \frac{i}{k^2-\left|M\right|^2}\,,\qquad
\left\langle \phi^2_{\rm qu}, \phi^2_{\rm qu}\right\rangle = \frac{g_0^2\,\chi }{2 }\, \frac{i}{k^2-\left|M\right|^2}\,.
\label{326}
\eeq
where 
\beq
\left|M\right|\equiv \left|M_1\right|\equiv \left|M_2\right|\,.
\eeq
Now, combining (\ref{325}) and (\ref{326}) to evaluate the tadpoles graphs of Fig. XXX
with $\phi^1_{\rm qu}$ and $\phi^2_{\rm qu}$ running inside
we arrive at
\begin{eqnarray}
	D^1_{\rm one-loop} 
	&=&
	\frac{1}{4\pi}\, \ln \frac{\left| M_{\rm uv}\right|^2}{\left|M\right|^2}
 \nonumber\\[3mm]
 	&\times&
	\left( \frac{1-\left| \phi^1_{\rm b}
	  \right|^2}{\chi} - \frac{\left| \phi^1_{\rm b}
	  \right|^2}{\chi}
	\right)^{\phi_{\rm b}^{1}=0}_{\phi_{\rm b}^{1}=\infty}
  \nonumber\\[3mm]
	&=&
	  \frac{1}{4\pi}\, \ln \frac{\left| M_{\rm uv}\right|^2}{\left|M\right|^2}
	  \left(2 + 1
	  \right).
\end{eqnarray}
\marginpar{\tiny The order of the limits is reversed in the formula above}
	where $M_{\rm uv}$ is an ultraviolet cut-off (e.g. the Pauli-Villars regulator mass). 
	The first and second terms in the parentheses come from the $\phi^1_{\rm qu}$ and $\phi^2_{\rm qu}$ loops, respectively. 
	In the general case of the CP$^{N-1}$ model
	one must replace $2+1$ by $2+ 1\times (N-2) = N$.

	This information allows us to obtain the contribution of the Killing potential to the central charge at one loop, namely,
\beq
\Delta_{\rm K}{\mathcal Z} = -2M_1\left[\frac{1}{g_0^2} -
\frac{3}{4\pi} \left(\ln\left|\frac{M_{\rm uv}}{M} 
\right| +1
\right)
\right]
\label{329}
\eeq
	Note that the renormalized coupling in the case at hand is \cite{Novikov:1984ac}
\beq
\frac{1}{g^2}=
\frac{1}{g_0^2} -
\frac{3}{4\pi}  \ln\left|\frac{M_{\rm uv}}{M} \right | \equiv   \frac{3}{4\pi}  \ln\left|\frac{M}{\Lambda}\right|\,.
\label{330}
\eeq
	For the generic CP$^{N-1}$ model the coefficient 3 in front of the logarithm 
	in (\ref{330}) is replaced by $N$. 
	Equation (\ref{330}) serves as a (standard) definition of the dynamical scale parameter $\Lambda$ 
	in perturbation theory.

\subsubsection{Contribution of the Noether charges}

This is not the end of the story, however. We must add to $\Delta_{\rm K}{\mathcal Z}$
a part of the central charge associated with the Noether terms in (\ref{21}), which accounts for the quantization of the
fermion zero modes as well as effects of the $\theta$ term.

\subsubsection{Weak-coupling expansion}
%\setcounter{equation}{0}

       We can start from the known superpotential of the Veneziano--Yankielowicz type, and the spectrum that it generates.
       It gives the  exact solution of the CP$^{N-1}$ model with twisted masses in the BPS sector. 
       In our case of $\mc{Z}_N$ symmetric twisted masses this superpotential is given in \cite{Bolokhov:2011mp}.
       
       Here we narrow down to the case of CP$^2$, with masses that are $ \mc{Z}_3 $ symmetric.
       The central charge determining the BPS spectrum is given by the difference of the values of the superpotential in  two vacua.
       The general formula adjusted for CP$^2$ is as follows \cite{Bolokhov:2011mp}:
\begin{eqnarray}
       \mc{Z}\Big|^{\scriptscriptstyle +\infty}_{\scriptscriptstyle -\infty} 
       &=&
       U_0(m_0)  ~~+~~ i\, n\, M_1 ~~+~~ i\, \left\{
       \begin{array}{ll}
       m_0\\[1mm]m_2
       \end{array}
       \right.
       \nonumber\\[3mm]
       &\stackrel{|m_0|\to\infty}{\longrightarrow}&
       \frac{3}{2\pi}\, M^1\, \Big\{ \ln\, \frac {   |M_1|   }
                                                 {  \Lambda  } -1 \Big\} -  \frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}}\; M_1\, +i\,n\, M_1
       +  i\,\left\{
       \begin{array}{ll}
       m_0\\[1mm]m_2
       \end{array}
       \right. +
       ...
        \nonumber\\[3mm]
       \label{331}
\end{eqnarray}
       where the ellipsis represents  suppressed terms dying off as inverse powers of the large mass parameter.
       As was mentioned, we assume the parameter $ m^0 $ in Eq. (\ref{331}) to be real 
       and positive (this assumption is inessential and can be easily lifted, but we will not do it in this paper).

It is not difficult to rearrange the last double-valued term presenting it as a linear combination of $m_0+m_2$ and $M_2$.
Then Equation (\ref{331}) takes the form
\beq
   \mc{Z} = 
       \frac{3}{2\pi}\, M_1\, \left(  \ln\, \frac {   |M_1|   }
                                                 {  \Lambda  } -1 \right) +i\,n \, M_1
                                                 -\frac{i}{4} \, M_1 \mp \frac{i}{2}\, M_2\,.
                                                 \label{332}
\eeq
\marginpar{\tiny Check the last two terms in the above equation}


       Theoretically it is possible to redefine $ \Lambda $ by switching on the $\theta$ term,
       which can be introduced as a phase of $\Lambda$, namely $\Lambda \to \Lambda e^{-i\theta /3}$.
       The Veneziano--Yankielowicz superpotential is defined with a ``non-perturbative'' 
       $ \Lambda_\text{np} $, which may be related to the perturbative $ \Lambda_\text{pt} $ as
       \beq
       \Lambda_\text{np}^3 =  -i \, \Lambda_\text{pt}^3\,. 
       \eeq
       
       \marginpar{\tiny The phase has to be settled later, OK?}

\subsection{Quasiclassical Kink Solution in CP\boldmath{$^2$}}
\setcounter{equation}{0}
\label{kinksolu}

	In this section we will briefly discuss the kink solution in CP$^2$. 
	In fact, the bosonic part (and its quantization), 
	as well as the fermion zero mode in $\psi^1$ are the same as in CP$^1$ \cite{Shifman:2007ce}. 
	The crucial difference is the occurrence of a localized (but nonzero!) mode in $\psi^2$.

\subsubsection{What to expect for the kink mass}

Let us return to Eq. (\ref{332}). For the time being we will ignore the second and the third terms is this formula.
The second term can be nullified by setting $n=0$. The third term, as discussed above,
can be absorbed into the $\theta$ angle. Then $\mc{Z} $ takes the form 
\beq
\mc{Z} = -\left\{  \frac{3}{2\pi}\, M_1\, \left(  \ln\, \frac {   |M_1|   }
                                                 {  \Lambda  } -1 \right) 
                                                 \pm
                                                 \frac{i}{2}\, M_2
                                                 \right\} 
                                                 \label{41}
\eeq
and $M_{\rm kink} = |\mc{Z}|$. To simplify further discussion now it is convenient  to change phase conventions.
We will assume $M_1$ to be real and negative, $-M_1\equiv |M_1|$. This can be always done. This will change the $\theta$ angle, but we will 
defer consideration of  the $\theta$-induced effects until later.

If $M_1$ is real and negative, then Re$~M_2$  can be absorbed into $\theta$, while Im$M_2$ shifts
the absolute value of $|\mc{Z}|$ and, hence, the kink mass. For the time 
being we can ignore the unit term in the parentheses in (\ref{41}) associated with the anomaly in the central charge,
and focus on the effect due to  Im$~M_2$,
\begin{align}
	{\rm Im}~M_2 
	& ~~=~~
	-\, \frac{\sqrt 3}{2}\, \left|M_1\right| ~~=~~ M_2 ~~-~~ \frac{M_1}{2}\,,
 \nonumber\\[3mm]
	 M_{\rm kink} 
	 &~~=~~
	 \frac{2|M_1|}{g^2} ~~\pm~~ {\rm Im}~M_2 ~~=~~ 
	 \frac{2|M_1|}{g^2} ~~\mp~~ \frac{\sqrt 3}{2}\,\left|M_1\right| \,.
\end{align}


\subsubsection{Kink solution}

In the classical kink solution the field $\phi^2$ is not involved. The BPS equation for $\phi^1$ is the same as in CP$^1$, namely,
\beq
\quad \partial_z \phi = |M| \phi\,.
\label{13twentysix}
\eeq
The solution of this equation  can be written as
\beq
\phi (z) = e^{|M|(z-z_0) -i\alpha}\,.
\label{13twentyseven}
\eeq
Here $z_0$ is the kink center while $\alpha$ is an arbitrary phase related to U(1)$_1$.
In fact, these two parameters enter only in the combination
$|m| z_0 +i\alpha$. The kink center 
is complexified. 

The effect of the modulus $\alpha$ explains the occurrence of 
$nM_1$ from the Noether part.

\subsubsection{Quantization of the bosonic moduli}

To carry out  conventional
quasiclassical quantization we, as usual,
assume the moduli\index{moduli} $z_0$ and $\alpha$ in Eq. (\ref{13twentyseven})
to be (weakly) time-dependent, substitute  (\ref{13twentyseven})
in the bosonic part of the Lagrangian, integrate over $z$
and arrive at
\beq
{\cal L}_{\rm QM} = -M_{\rm kink} +\frac{M_{\rm kink}}{2} \dot z_0^2 
+\left\{\frac{1}{g^2|M|}\, \dot\alpha^2  
-\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\,\dot\alpha
\right\}.
\label{13twentynine}
\eeq
The first term is the classical kink mass, the second describes
free motion of the kink along the $z$ axis.
The term in the braces is most interesting.
The variable $\alpha$ is compact.
Its very existence is related to the exact U(1) symmetry of the model.
The energy spectrum corresponding
to $\alpha$ dynamics is quantized.
It is not difficult to see that
\beq
E_{[\alpha ]}= \frac{g^2 |M|}{4}\,\, q_{\rm U(1)}^2\,,
\label{13thirty}
\eeq
where
$ q_{\rm U(1)}$ is the U(1) charge of the soliton,
\beq
 q_{\rm U(1)} = k +\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\,,\qquad k =\mbox{ an integer}\,.
\label{13thirtyone}
\eeq
The kink U(1) charge is no longer integer
in the presence of the $\theta$ term, it is shifted by $\theta/(2\pi )$.

\subsubsection{Fermions in quasiclassical consideration}

First we will  focus on the 
zero modes of $\psi^1$ in the kink background (\ref{13twentyseven}).
The coefficients
in front of the fermion zero modes will become (time-dependent)
 fermion moduli, for which we are going to build
corresponding quantum mechanics. 
There are two such moduli, $\bar\eta$ and $\eta$.

The equations for the fermion zero modes are
\beqn
&\partial_z\psi_L^1&    - \frac{2}{\chi}\left(\bar\phi^1\partial_z\phi^1
\right)\psi_L^1 -i\,\frac{1-\bar\phi^1\phi^1}{\chi}\, |M| e^{i\beta}\psi_R^1
=0\,,
\nonumber\\[3mm]
&\partial_z\psi_R^1&   - \frac{2}{\chi}\left(\bar\phi^1\partial_z\phi^1
\right)\psi_R^1 + i\,\frac{1-\bar\phi^1\phi^1}{\chi}\, |M| e^{- i\beta}\psi_L^1=0
\label{13fourtyfour}
\eeqn
(plus   similar equations for $\bar\psi$; since our operator is 
Hermitean we do not need to consider them separately.)

It is not difficult to find solution to these 
equations, either directly, or using supersymmetry.
Indeed, if we know the bosonic solution (\ref{13twentyseven}),
its fermionic superpartner --- and the fermion zero modes are such 
 superpartners --- is obtained from the
bosonic one by those two supertransformations which act on
$\bar\phi\,,\,\,\phi$ nontrivially.
In this way we conclude that the
  functional form of the fermion zero mode 
must coincide  with the functional form of the boson  
  solution (\ref{13twentyseven}). Concretely,
\beq
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\psi_R\\  \psi_L
\end{array}
\right)=\eta 
\left(\frac{g^2|M|}{2}\right)^{1/2}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
-ie^{-i\beta}\\   1
\end{array}
\right)e^{|M|(z-z_0)}
\label{13fourtyfive}
\eeq
 and
 \beq
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\bar \psi_R^1\\  \bar \psi_L^1
\end{array}
\right)=\bar\eta \left(\frac{g^2|M|}{2}\right)^{1/2} \left(\begin{array}{c}
ie^{ i\beta}\\   1
\end{array}
\right)e^{|M|(z-z_0)}\,,
\label{13fourtysix}
\eeq
where the numerical factor is introduced to ensure proper
normalization of the quantum-mechanical Lagrangian.
Another solution which asymptotically, at large $z$, behaves
as $e^{3|M|(z-z_0)}$ must be discarded as non-normalizable.

Now, to
perform   quasiclassical quantization we follow the standard route:
the moduli\index{moduli} are assumed to be   time-dependent, and we derive 
quantum mechanics of moduli starting from the original Lagrangian.
Substituting the kink solution   and the fermion zero modes for
$\Psi$ one gets
\beq
{\cal L}'_{\rm QM} = i\, \bar\eta\dot\eta\,.
\label{13fourtyseven}
\eeq
In the Hamiltonian approach the only remnants of the fermion moduli
are the anticommutation relations
\beq
\{\bar\eta\eta\} =1\,,\quad \{\bar\eta \bar\eta\} =0\,,\quad \{\eta \eta\} =0\,,
\label{13fourtyeight}
\eeq
which tell us that the wave function is two-component
(i.e. the kink supermultiplet is two-dimensional). One can implement
Eq. (\ref{13fourtyeight}) by choosing e.g. 
$\bar\eta=\sigma^+$, $ \eta=\sigma^-$.

\subsubsection{Combining bosonic and fermionic moduli}
\label{cbfm}

Quantum dynamics of the kink at hand is summarized by the
Hamiltonian
\beq
H_{\rm QM} =  \frac{M_{\rm kink}}{2}\,\dot{\bar\zeta}\, \dot\zeta
\label{13fourtynine}
\eeq
acting in the space of two-component wave functions.
The variable $\zeta$ here is a complexified kink center,
\beq
\zeta = z_0 + \frac{i}{|M|}\, \alpha\,.
\label{13fifty}
\eeq
For simplicity, we set the vacuum angle $\theta =0$ for the time being
(it will be reinstated later). 

The original field theory we deal with has four conserved supercharges.
Two of them, ${\mathcal Q}$ and $\bar {\mathcal Q}$, 
act trivially in the critical kink sector. In moduli quantum
mechanics they take the form
\beq
{\mathcal Q}= {\sqrt M_0}\,  \dot\zeta\eta\,,\qquad 
\bar {\mathcal Q}=  {\sqrt M_0}\, \dot{\bar\zeta}\bar \eta \, ;
\label{13fiftyone}
\eeq
they do indeed vanish provided that the kink is at rest.
Superalgebra\index{superalgebra} describing kink quantum mechanics is
$\{\bar {\mathcal Q}\, {\mathcal Q}\} = 2 H_{\rm QM}$. This is nothing but 
Witten's ${\mathcal N}=1$
supersymmetric quantum mechanics  (two supercharges).
The realization we deal with is peculiar and distinct from 
that of Witten. Indeed, the standard Witten quantum mechanics
includes one (real) bosonic degree of freedom and two fermionic, while
we have two bosonic degrees of freedom,
$x_0$ and $\alpha$. Nevertheless, superalgebra remains the same
due to the fact that the bosonic coordinate is complexified.
 
Finally, to conclude this section, let us calculate the U(1) charge
of the kink states. Starting from the expression  for the U(1)$_1$ current we
substitute the fermion zero modes and get\,\footnote{To set the scale properly, so that
the U(1) charge of the vacuum state vanishes, one must
antisymmetrize
the fermion current, $\bar\psi\gamma^\mu\psi \to
(1/2)\left(\bar\psi\gamma^\mu\psi - \bar\psi^c\gamma^\mu\psi^c
\right)
$ where the superscript c denotes $C$ conjugation.}
\beq
\Delta q_{\rm U(1)} = \frac{1}{2} [\bar\eta\eta ]
\label{13fiftytwo}
\eeq
(this is to be added to the bosonic part, Eq. (\ref{13thirtyone})).
Given that $\bar \eta = \sigma^+$ and $ \eta = \sigma^-$ we arrive at
$\Delta q_{\rm U(1)} = \frac{1}{2} \sigma_3$. This means that the U(1)$_1$ charges
of two kink states in the supermultiplet
split from the value given in Eq. (\ref{13thirtyone}):
one has the U(1)$_1$ charge
$$
k+\frac{1}{2} +\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\,,
$$
and another
$$
k-\frac{1}{2} +\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\,.
$$

\subsubsection{Bound States of $\psi^2$ with the eigenvalue $\sqrt{3}|M^1|/2$}
\label{bound}



       To find the non-zero mode, we write out the linearized Dirac equations in the background
       of the $ \phi^1 $ kink.
       For convenience, we rescale the variable $ z $ into a dimensionless variable $ s $:
\beq
       s ~~=~~ 2\, |M^1|\, z\,.
\eeq
       Then the kink takes the form
\beq
       \phi^1(s) ~~=~~ e^{s/2}\,,\qquad\qquad\text{and}\quad \phi^k(s) ~~=~~ 0 \qquad \text{for}~~ k ~>~ 1\,,
\eeq
       or
\begin{align}
%
\notag
       n^0  & ~~=~~ \frac {             1              }
                          {    \sqrt{ 1 ~+~ e^s }      }\,, \\[3mm]
%
\notag
       n^1  & ~~=~~ \frac {          e^{s/2}           }
                          {    \sqrt{ 1 ~+~ e^s }      }\,, \\[3mm]
%
\notag
       n^2  & ~~=~~ \qquad~~\, 0\,,  \\[2mm]
%	 
            & ~~~\,\vdots          \\[2mm]
%
\notag
       n^k  & ~~=~~ \qquad~~\, 0\,,  \\[2mm]
%	 
\notag
            & ~~~\,\vdots          \\[2mm]
%
\notag
       n^{N-1} & ~~=~~ \qquad~~\, 0\,.                
\end{align}

       The masses will also turn dimensionless by the same factor,
\beq
       \mu^l  ~~=~~ \frac{ m^l }
                        {2 |M^1|}\,,
	\qquad
	\text{and}
	\qquad
	\mu_G^a ~~=~~ \frac{ M^a }
                          {2 |M^1|}\,,
\eeq
       written both for geometric and gauge formulations.

       The linearized Dirac equations for the fermion $ \psi^k $ with $ k ~>~ 1 $ then look like
\begin{align}
%
\notag
       \Big\{ \p_s  ~-~ \frac{1}{2}\, f(s) \Big\}\,\, \psi_R^k   ~~+~~  i \lgr  \mu_G^1\, f(s)  ~-~  \mu_G^k \rgr\! \cdot \psi_L^k  
       & ~~=~~ \phantom{-} i\, \lambda\, \psi_L^k   \\[2mm]
%
       \Big\{ \p_s  ~-~ \frac{1}{2}\, f(s) \Big\}\,\, \psi_L^k   ~~-~~  i \lgr \ov{\mu}{}_G^1\, f(s)  ~-~ \ov{\mu}{}_G^k \rgr\! \cdot \psi_R^k 
       & ~~=~~ - i\, \ov{\lambda}\, \psi_R^k \,.
\end{align}
       Here $ f(s) $ is a real function
\beq
       f(s) ~~=~~ \frac{     e^s     }
                       { 1  ~+~  e^s }\,.
\eeq
       Eigenvalue $ \lambda $ is zero for zero-modes, or gives the energy for non-zero modes.
       If one starts from the gauged formulation, one arrives at a simpler system, which can be obtained from the
       above one by redefinition of the functions.
       That is, the conversion between the geometric and gauge formulations is precisely such as to remove the inhomogeneous term from the
       figure brackets,
\begin{align}
%
\notag
       \p_s\, \xi_R^k  ~~+~~  i \lgr \mu_G^1\, f(s) ~-~ \mu_G^k \rgr\! \cdot \xi_L^k  & ~~=~~ \phantom{-} i\, \lambda\, \xi_L^k \\[2mm]
%
       \p_s\, \xi_L^k  ~~-~~  i \lgr \ov{\mu}{}_G^1\, f(s) ~-~ \ov{\mu}{}_G^k \rgr\! \cdot \xi_R^k & ~~=~~ - i\, \ov{\lambda}\, \xi_R^k \,.
\end{align}
       
       This system does not allow normalizable zero modes.
       However, there is a normalizable non-zero mode with the energy given by the absolute value of 
\beq
       \lambda  ~~=~~  - \mu_G^k  ~+~ \frac{1}{2} \mu_G^1\,.
\eeq
       The mode is
\begin{align}
%
\notag
       \xi_R^k  & ~~=~~  \lgr \frac{  e^{\alpha s}  }
                                   {   1 ~+~ e^s    }  \rgr^{ 1/2 }  \\[2mm]
%
       \xi_L^k  & ~~=~~  - i\, \frac{ \ov{\mu}{}_G^1 }
                                    {  | \mu_G^1 |   } \cdot \xi_R^k\,.
\end{align}
%       It is  BPS-saturated. 
       That it is BPS can be seen from the expansion of the central charge
\beq
       |\, r \cdot M^1  ~+~ i\, M^k \,|  ~~=~~ r \cdot | M^1 |  ~~-~~ | M^k | \cdot \sin \text{Arg}\; \frac { M^k } 
                                                                                                            { M^1 }  
                                                                ~~+~~ ... \,,
\eeq
       in the large coupling constant $ r $.
       This is the central charge of the bound state of a fermion and the kink 
       as discovered by Dorey {\it et al.} \cite{Dorey:1999zk}, written semi-classically.

%\section{Weak Coupling Expansion}
%\setcounter{equation}{0}

%       We can start from the exact known superpotential, and the spectrum that it generates.
%       Here we narrow down to the case of CP$^2$, with masses concord with $ Z^3 $ symmetry.

%       The spectrum we think is given by the difference of superpotentials at the two vacua 
%       plus the addition of masses \cite{Bolokhov:2011mp},
%\beq
%       \mc{Z}\Big|^{\scriptscriptstyle +\infty}_{\scriptscriptstyle -\infty} ~~=~~
%       U_0(m_0)  ~~+~~ i\, n\, M_1 ~~+~~ i\, m^k\,,
%       \qquad\qquad k~=~1,\,2\,.
%\eeq

%       In the semi-classical limit, this gives,
%\beq
%       \mc{Z} ~~=~~
%       \frac{3}{2\pi}\, M^1\, \Big\{ \ln\, \frac {   |M_1|   }
%                                                 {  \Lambda  } ~-~ 3 \Big\}
%       ~~+~~ i\, m^k 
%       ~~-~~ \frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}}\; M_1\, 
%       ~~+~~ ...
%\eeq
%       where the ellipsis represents the suppressed terms.
%       This expression is obtained in the limit of large masses, with $ m^0 $ held real and positive. 
%       Theoretically it is possible to redefine $ \Lambda $ such that the last unsuppressed term
%       turns into $ -\, i\, m^0 $.
%       That is, the Veneziano-Yankielowicz superpotential is defined with a ``non-perturbative'' 
%       $ \Lambda_\text{np} $, which is related to the perturbative one $ \Lambda_\text{pt} $ in such 
%       a way as to turn the unsuppressed term exactly into
%\beq
%       i \, (\, m^k ~-~ m^0 \,)  ~~=~~ i\, M_k\,.
%\eeq
%       This way the expansion of the exact superpotential would agree with the perturbative formula above.

\subsection{Matching the Central Charges}
\setcounter{equation}{0}

       The following central charges need to meet the correspondence.
\vspace{0.6cm}

\begin{itemize}
\item
       The 4-dimensional central charge (at the root of the baryonic Higgs branch),
\beq
       \mc{Z}  ~~=~~ i\, \vec{n}{}_m \cdot \vec{a}{}_D  ~~+~~ i\, \vec{n}{}_e \cdot \vec{a}  
               ~~+~~ i\, m^a \cdot S^a ~~+~~ i\, m^k \; \vec{w}^k
\eeq

\item
       For magnetic charge one, and electric charge $ \vec{\alpha}{}_1 $ this gives, up to normalization,
\beq
       \mc{Z}  ~~=~~ i\, a_D(m_0)  ~~+~~ i\, ( m^1 ~-~ m^0 )\, n ~~+~~ i\, ( m^k ~-~ m^0 )\,.
\eeq

\item
       Our 2-d expression for the central charge gives
\beq
       \mc{Z}  ~~=~~ U_0(m_0)      ~~+~~ i\, ( m^1 ~-~ m^0 )\, n ~~+~~ i\, m^k\,. 
\eeq
       It could be that the four-dimensional $ \Lambda $ differs from the two-dimensional one, although
       then one of them would have to depend on the masses.

\item
       The above two-dimensional charge, when expanded, gives
\beq
       \mc{Z} ~~=~~        
       \frac{3}{2\pi}\, (m^1 ~-~ m^0)\, \bigg\{ \ln\, \frac {   | m^1 \,-\, m^0 |   }
                                                            {        \Lambda        } ~-~ 3 \bigg\}
       ~~+~~ i\, m^k 
       ~~-~~ \frac{1}{4\sqrt{3}}\; ( m^1 ~-~ m^0 )\, 
       ~~+~~ ...
\eeq

\item
       The perturbative result gives 
\beq
       \mc{Z} ~~=~~        
       \frac{3}{2\pi}\, (m^1 ~-~ m^0)\, \bigg\{ \ln\, \frac {   | m^1 \,-\, m^0 |   }
                                                            {        \Lambda        } ~-~ 1 \bigg\}
       ~~+~~ i\, ( m^k ~-~ m^0)
\eeq

\item
       The original classical expression is
\beq
       \mc{Z} ~~=~~ i\, (m^k ~-~ m^0)\, q^k  ~~+~~ (m^k ~-~ m^0) \cdot D^k \Big|^{\scriptscriptstyle +\infty}_{\scriptscriptstyle -\infty}
\eeq
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.2cm}
       All these expressions must agree with each other
